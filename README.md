# Skeletal Age 

A novel `Skeletal Age` metric as the age of an individual’s skeleton resulting from a fragility fracture to convey the combined risk of fracture and fracture-associated mortality for an individual with specific risk profile.

# What is included?

The list of available datasets (csv and docs) is available here:

  - [HTML
    index](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/articles/data.html)
  - [CSV

On the github repository you will also find the scripts I use to scrape
data and update the website.

## Data & Models
R datasets can be downloaded from [KneeXrayData](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/56rmx5bjcr/1). The sample dataset can be download from dataset folder.

like me to add data from a new package.

## Citation
Please consider `cite` the paper if you use the code or data for your research.

# License

The code in this repository is licensed under GPL-3.

I believe that the R documentation which I copied to the Rdatasets html
folder is licensed under GPL. You will find a copy of the GPL in the
Rdatasets github repository.

I made a good faith effort to determine the license under which the
actual data (i.e. rows/columns of numbers) were distributed, but I was
unable to find a definitive answer. My understanding is that these
datasets are free to re-distribute. However, if you own the rights to
data that are included here and you object to their inclusion in
Rdatasets, send me an email at <SonThach.Tran@uts.edu.au>. I
will promptly remove the data in question and will make sure that all
traces are erased from the git revision history.
